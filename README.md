# Proteus

This is a repo for the paper "PROTEUS: A Pipelined Number Theoretic TransformArchitecture Synthesizer for HE and ZKP". It includes a synthesizer for Radix-2 Single-path Delay Feedback (SDF) and Multi-path Delay Commutator (MDC).

We'll make our source code available here if our paper gets accepted.
